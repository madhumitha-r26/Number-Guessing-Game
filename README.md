# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple project developed using python programming language in which the user can win the game by guessing the correct number that is randomly generated by the system.

Here we are getting three inputs:
- Lower limit
- Upper limit
- Number of turns to play

The user can play the game by giving the number of turns.
The system generates the number between the given limits.
At first the score will be at zero.
Once the user found the correct random number, their score gets incremented by 1. It displays a message "FANTASTIC!" to the user.
Otherwise their score gets decremented by 1.  It displays a message "TRY AGAIN!" to the user.
If the user is at the last turn, the score will be printed.
If the score matches to the number of turns, the user wins the game with a message "YOU WON!" otherwise "WELL PLAYED!" message will be printed.
